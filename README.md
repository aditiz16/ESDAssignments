# ESD Assignments
To perform the assignments with STM32F4xx series MCU , STM Cube IDE was used and for assignments with RTOS (uC/OS-II) and kiel microvision 4 was used for text editors, debugging and download into the microcontrollers. 


This repository contains only the source -> main.c file as most of it is embedded C code FOR the HAL functions it is necessary to configure the STM microcontrollers on the .ioc and configurations tabs. 

## List of Assignments performed on STM32F4xx
1. Blink an LED
2. Blink an LED as per the state of switch
3. Interfacing of LCD and display string
4. Interfacing UART and transmitting string
5. Interfacing ADC with a potentiometer
6. Blink Led using Timer delay
